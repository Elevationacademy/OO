## Class Theory

## Objects
Object Oriented Programming is a design pattern created to give our code reason, organization and extensibility (code re-use). To accomplish this architecture, we compare our 'inanimate' code, to 'animate' (real-world) objects. For example, let's compare a program that might have dogs in it, with a real dog. We can use our parts of speech to describe this dog.

* A _dog_ is a *noun*
* A dog might have a _breed_ of _golden retriever_. This is an *adjective*.
* A dog might be able to _bark_. This is a *verb*.

Now, if we think about this in terms of humble JavaScript, we might say the following:

* A *noun* in JS, is an *object* `{}`
* An *adjective* in JS is that *object's* properties `{ breed: 'golden_retriever' }`
* A *verb* in JS is that *object's* methods `{ bark: function () { } }`
